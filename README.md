# Spring Boot CRUD Project with PostgreSQL, JDBC, and JPA

This Spring Boot CRUD project showcases basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations implemented with PostgreSQL as the database, using both JDBC and JPA for data access. Postman is used for API testing.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a RESTful API for managing a collection of resources in a PostgreSQL database. The primary focus is on performing CRUD operations on the resource entities.

### Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** Provides a robust framework for building Java applications.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful open-source relational database.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):** Used for low-level database operations.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API):** Simplifies database access and ORM.
- **Postman:** Used for testing the API endpoints.
